#Active Region Detection Parameters (some from higgins et al. 2011)
#Some are new for HMI and not discussed in the paper... to be published...
#
#This version is specifically for generating simple SMART2 AR detections (not producing mag properties, core detections, etc)
#
#Parameter; Value; Type; Comment
#
#These may be used if a FITS header is missing
mdi_dx; 1.98394; F; arcsecs per px in x direction
mdi_dy; 1.98394; F; arcsecs per px in y direction
mdi_rsun; 975.147; F; radius of Sun in arcsecs 
mdi_level; 1.8; F; prepped level of the MDI data used (LMSAL data archive)
#
#Switches
doproject; 0; I; do the detection and area calculation in a projected equal shape or area space (projects and then unprojects)
docosmicray; 1; I; do cosmic ray detection and fill in with NaN
domedianfilt; 1; I; process the magnetogram using median smoothing to help with noise (seems to cause noise detections at the limb!)
#
#Magnetogram Processing
cosmicthresh; 5000.; F; A hard threshold for detecting cosmic rays
medfiltwidth; 3.; F; the width of a box to use to perform median filter on magnetogram
#
#Projection Parameters
threshlon; 90.; F; the deg. to LOS to go out to for the projection
projscl; 1.5; F; the fractional increase/decrease in image size for the projected image
#
#MDI SMART detection based on pixel size determined from map structure and supergranule physical size
smoothphys; 16.; F; Physical gaussian smoothing HWHM in Mm. The radius of a characteristic supergranule 
smooththresh; 20.0; F; a segmentation threshold used in processing MDI magnetograms (for 1kx1k gaussian smoothed; Determined from HMI QS study: http://pohuiginlabnotes.wordpress.com/2013/04/18/hmi-qs-characterisation/ )
magthresh; 200.0; F; a secondary segmentation threshold (for MDI) used to find all flux fragments in an image
#
#MDI Core detection: use PSLs and strong field to detect the flaring cores of ARs
strongthresh; 200.0; F; a segmentation threshold to detect strong field fragments which are then dilated to form the 'cores' of ARs.
polethresh; .8; F; imbalanced fraction of total area covered by a given (+ or -) polarity (=abs(npos-nneg)/abs(npos+nneg)), below which, the detection will be considered multipolar (core passes the flux balance test)
#
#YAFTA Tracking Parameters for SMART detections in MDI data
#Everything is set to ridiculously low thresholds because I want everything that SMART detects to be tracked
yaftathresh; 1.; F; ignore pixels below this value [G]
yaftapeakthresh; 1.; F; not sure what this is used for...
yaftaminsize; 1; I; only track features w/min_size pixels [Npx]
yaftadx; 1.433E8; F; MDI Full Disk pixel size [cm]
yaftaminflux; 1.; F; if it has less flux, it ain't an AR! [Mx]
yaftabipolethresh; 0.; F; need at least *some* minority flux [fraction]
tlastfoundthresh;43200.0;F; The maximum time that can elapse with no detections being found before the tracking resets. (Allows for a couple bad datas with no detections, so as not to reset the tracking all the time.)
#
#Physical Constants and Handy Numbers
cmpmm; 1d16; F; Number centimeters in a mega meter
nan; -NaN; F; handy filler value for not-a-number situations
#
#Not Used Currently
#smoothpole; 5.; F; Threshold for polarity blob counting. smoothing radius/FWHM in pixels for AR prior to polarity counting
#threshpole; .1; F; fraction of total area covered by a given (+ or -) polarity, below which, the detection will be considered monopolar

#gradthreshs; 150.; F; Gradient threshold for strong polarity separation lines?
mdi_noisethresh; 70.0; F; a noise threshold used in processing MDI magnetograms
#pdatamag; ~/science/procedures/chole_detect/data/mag/; A; a path pointing to the source data directory for the magnetogram input images
